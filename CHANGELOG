# CHANGELOG

FDS API Python SDK v1.0.0 (2024-04-19):
    - Update to API 1.0.0, Exoops legacy 1.8.7
    - Roadmaps:
        - Introduction of timeline (list of dictionaries to store all roadmap events) to better visualize the roadmap.
        - Addition of warm-up attitude in the RoadmapFromActions class.
        - Automatic calculation of roadmap end and start dates (if not provided) based on the actions.
        - Addition of RETROGRADE-NADIR AttitudeMode (thruster opposite to the velocity vector and z axis pointing to nadir).
        - Added compatibility check between FiringAction and Thruster (if firing is longer than the thruster's capacity).
        - Easier export of roadmaps to format compatible with pandas DataFrame.
    - Orbit determination:
        - Addition of the firing analysis report (when a roadmap with firings is provided).
        - Addition of ThrustVectorEstimationRequest class to estimate the thrust vector based on the orbit determination results.
    - Orbit extrapolation:
        - Ephemerides: added interface for multiple ephemerides request and outputs (POWER, PROPULSION, CARTESIAN, KEPLERIAN, ATTITUDE_QUATERNIONS, ATTITUDE_EULER_ANGLES)
        - Added support for CIRF/ECI frame for CCSDS file export.
        - Added flag for covariance propagation (propagate covariance matrix with the state).
        - Added possibility to return all orbital states at roadmap events (RequiredOrbitalStates).
    - Orbital state: Made covariance matrix and spacecraft updateable. Requires save() method to be called after modification.
    - Thruster: Made thruster power (firing, warm-up, and standby) and thrust magnitude updateable.
    - Spacecraft: Made propellant mass updateable (recomputes the platform mass). Requires save() method to be called after modification.
    - Two Line Elements:
        - added checksum recalculation at modification.
        - NORAD ID is now an integer in the retrieval from SpaceTrack.
    - Models: added possibility to force the save into the API client (with a new ID).
    - Minor bug fixes and improvements.

FDS API Python SDK v0.1.3:
- Added possibility to propagate ephemerides (CARTESIAN, KEPLERIAN, POWER, PROPULSION)
- Minor improvements and correction of minor bugs
- Update of java backend to v0.1.3.

FDS API Python SDK v0.1.2:
- Renamed and restructured the package, with more intuitive names and structure
- All use cases are now initialised through an OrbitalState object
- Orbit determination: added possibility to estimate the drag coefficient and the reflectivity coefficient (in determination.requests)
- Added TLE extrapolation with SGP4
- Orbit extrapolation: added possibility to write covariance in OEM files
- Added Quaternion class with some basic operations to represent rotations
- Added utils in orbital mechanics, geometry, frame transformations, math from validated libraries (i.e. Celestlab)
- Removed dependency on spacetrack package: a SpacetrackClient is now required to retrieve TLEs.
- Use of loguru for logging
- Loading of environment variables from .env file is now done automatically by the package initialization on import
- Updated the documentation
- Updated unit tests
- Minor improvements and correction of minor bugs

FDS API Python SDK v0.0.9:
- Updated `OrbitalState` objects, that can be created through class methods `with_tle` or `with_orbit`
- OrbitDetermination is now initialised through an OrbitalState object (instead of tle, propagation context, covariance and spacecraft)
- Updated results (objects `ResultOrbitExtrapolation`, `ResultOrbitDetermination`, `ResultManeuverGeneration`) for better readibility
- Removed usage of `DiagonalCovarianceMatrix` in favor of `CovarianceMatrix` (initialisation with diagonal is possible with the class method `from_diagonal`)
- Added example scripts with focus on post-processing and visualization of results
- Updated the documentation
- Other minor improvements and correction of minor bugs

FDS API Python SDK v0.0.7:
- Added possibility to generate Orbit Ephemerides Message (OEM) files in Orbit Extrapolation
- Added orbitType field to covariance matrix
- Added example file for Orbit determination and Orbit Extrapolation with production of ephemeredes
- Updated and completed the documentation
- Other minor improvements and correction of minor bugs
